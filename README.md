To-do list


##Click index.html
##Download Raw File
##Open File




This is my 1st and a very simple This straightforward web-based to-do list tool enables users 
To:
•	Add new tasks
•	Delete tasks when completed
•	Delete all tasks by refreshing the tab

Tools and language-

I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used HTML for structuring the app, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity like adding, removing and so on.

Steps to build and run it-

Firstly, I have written my code in Visual Studio Code. I have named my files as –
•  index.html
•  style.css
•  script.js
The codes are attached in my GitHub link.

Challenges or key features-

The JavaScript and CSS codes were not running at first. Then I realized that my extensions in VS Code were not functioning properly. I have fixed them. I was struggling to handle user input edge cases, avoid UI Clutter, and store and sync the list of tasks in localStorage
